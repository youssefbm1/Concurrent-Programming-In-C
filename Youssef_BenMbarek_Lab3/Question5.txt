Question 5:
Analyze the delay_until procedure from file utils.c. Explain how this procedure can 
make the task wait well beyond the deadline if the execution of gettimeofday is not 
immediately followed by the execution of nanosleep.

Answer:
The delay_until function in utils.c uses a mutex and a condition variable to suspend
 the execution of the thread until a specific time (the absolute time). The mutex is
initialized and locked to protect access to the condition variable. Then, 
pthread_cond_timedwait is called to suspend the thread. This function unlocks the
mutex and puts the thread to sleep until the specified absolute time or until
another thread signals the condition variable. Finally, the mutex is unlocked.
This approach ensures that the thread is suspended until the absolute time, 
even if other processes or threads consume CPU time between the locking of the
mutex and the call to pthread_cond_timedwait.
